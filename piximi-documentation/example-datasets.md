MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a database of handwritten digits often used in machine learning.
Images are grayscale and 28x28 pixels and each image contains a single digit.
We provide a small subset of the full MNIST database.

We accesesd MNIST from a [website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) provided by the original authors. \

*Caenorhabditis elegans* is a nematode worm and is a commonly used model organism.
This dataset is images of transgenic *C. elegans* expressing the promoter of gene *clec-60* fused to GFP (*clec-60:GFP*) and an mCherry pharynx label.
In wild type worms, *clec-60:GFP* is expressed in posterior intestinal cells while in *pmk-1(km25)* mutants the *clec-60:GFP* is elevated in expression and visible in the anterior intestine, close to the pharynx.
There are multiple worms visible in each image.
Channel 1 is GFP, channel 2 is mCherry.

The *C. elegans* data were provided by Javier Irazoqui as BBBC012 in the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC012). \

These human U2OS cells express b-arrestin-GFP and an orphan GPCR.
When the GPCR is stimulated, b-arrestin-GFP is recruited to the plasma membrane and eventually endocytosed resulting in vesicle like structures.
Channel 1 is GFP, channel 2 is DNA.

The U2OS cells data were provided by Ilya Ravkin as BBBC016 in the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC016). \

These human U2OS osteosarcoma cells are stably transfected with fluorescently tagged Forkhead protein (FKHR-EGFP).
In proliferating cells, FKHR-EGFP is constantly trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm.
When treated with drugs that prevent PI3 kinase/PKB signaling, nuclear export is inhibited and FKHR-EGFP accumulates in the nucleus.
Channel 1 is FKHR-GFP,  channel 2 is DNA.

The U2OS cells cytoplasm crop data were provided by Ilya Ravkin as BBBC013 in the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC013). \

These human HeLa cells express either wild type or the disease-associated variant of PLP1 protein, which localizes differently than the healthy version.  
Channel 1 is artifacts, channel 2 is fluorescently tagged protein PLP1, and channel 3 is DNA.

The human PLP1 localization data were provided by Jessica Lacoste in [Mikko Taipale's lab](http://taipalelab.org/) at University of Toronto. \
